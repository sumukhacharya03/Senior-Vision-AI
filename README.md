## What is this Project about?

Many elderly individuals struggle to read the small print on supermarket productsâ€”whether it's due to vision issues, complicated labels, or unfamiliar terms. **Scan-n-Say** is a simple, smart scanning app that solves this problem.

Users can take a picture of any product, and the app will use AI to extract the important information, generate a friendly, jargon-free summary, and read it out loud. This makes grocery shopping easier, more independent, and far more enjoyable.

### Key Features

* **Instant Scan:** Uses the phone's camera to capture product packaging.
* **AI-Powered Summaries:** Leverages Google's Vision (OCR) and Gemini (LLM) APIs to extract text and create simple, helpful summaries.
* **Text-to-Speech:** Reads the summary aloud so there's no need to squint at the screen.
* **Modern & Accessible UI:** A clean, high-contrast interface with large buttons, designed specifically for elderly users.
